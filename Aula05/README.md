| **What it is**          | A UI component library for React Native, built on Material Design guidelines. Provides ready-to-use components (Appbar, Card, Button, Avatar, etc.). | A utility-first styling framework for React Native (Tailwind CSS for RN). Provides class-based styling with no prebuilt components. |
| **Primary Use**         | Build UI fast with pre-designed, accessible Material components.                                                                                     | Style your own components quickly with Tailwind-like classes.                                                                       |
| **Learning Curve**      | Easy to start if familiar with Material Design or Paper components.                                                                                  | Easy if you know Tailwind CSS; requires a bit of setup.                                                                             |
| **Customization**       | Theming system (light/dark, custom colors, typography) but limited flexibility compared to pure styles.                                              | Full control ‚Äî you write all styles with utility classes. No opinionated UI.                                                        |
| **Installation**        | `npm install react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons`                                                                                           | `npm install nativewind tailwindcss` + Babel config                                                                                 |

Only styling utilities.                                                               |
| **Styling Approach**    | Inline styles + theme props, Material guidelines enforced.                                                                                           | Class-based (`className="flex-row p-2 bg-red-500"`) with Tailwind rules.                                                            |
| **Accessibility**       | ‚úÖ Built-in accessibility support (ripple, keyboard nav, screen readers).                                                                             | ‚ùå Manual ‚Äî depends on how you build your components.                                                                                |
| **Best For**            | Apps that need Material Design, quick prototypes, or pre-styled complex UI (forms, dialogs, etc.).                                                   | Apps that need full design freedom, custom UI systems, or devs who love Tailwind.                                                   |
| **Ease of Theming**     | Centralized theme provider, supports dark mode easily.                                                                                               | You manage consistency manually (via Tailwind config, custom utilities).                                                            |
| **Performance**         | Solid, but more code since components are opinionated.                                                                                               | Very lightweight ‚Äî just utility styles applied at runtime.                                                                          |
| **When to Use**         | If you want **prebuilt components** and don‚Äôt want to design everything from scratch.                                                                | If you want **maximum flexibility** and a Tailwind-like dev experience.                                                             |
